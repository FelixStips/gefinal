                        You have been moved to a different market. This market differs from the market you were in before in two ways:

                    <ol>
                        <li>

                            There are {{ num_employers }} employers and {{ num_workers }} workers in this market. <br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Points in this market are worth more </b><br>
                            The exchange rate for point earned in this market will be <b>1 point = {{ exchange_rate_large_market }} Euros</b>.
                            This means that you can gain the same amount of money even for a wage offer that is {{ income_differential }} lower.
                            For example, if you accepted a wage of {{ example_wage }} points in the previous market, or you accept a wage of
                            {{ example_wage_large_market }} in this market, you will earn the same amount of money.

                        The difference is that {{ shock_size }} workers from another market have joined this market.
                        The number of employers is the same as in the first part of the experiment.
