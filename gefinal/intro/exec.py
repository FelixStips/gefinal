           <p class="block-sentence">
                The firms' profit in each round is determined by the wage they pay to all their workers, the effort you provide to them, the effort other workers provide, and the number of workers they employ.
               If they <b>do not employ any workers</b> in a round, they will earn a profit of {{ outside_option_employers_points_tokens }} {{ currency_plural }} in that round.
           </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
                If they employ at least one worker, their profit will be the difference between the revenue they gain from worker effort choices and the wage they pay to all workers:
