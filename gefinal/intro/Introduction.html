You are now participating in an economic experiment. This is a research project, which is designed to study economic decision-making. <br> <br>

The experiment consists of two parts. After you finished both parts there will be a short questionnaire followed by the payment. In total, the experiment should last for around 90 minutes. <br> <br>

During the game, you will interact with other participants through the computer. <b>Neither during nor after the games will you know with whom you have interacted.</b>
The participants you interact with are not necessarily sitting close to you (some of them will be sitting in another classroom). <br> <br>

<b>Please do not talk or communicate with other participants during the experiment.</b> This might disturb other people and invalidate the session. Also, please turn off or put away your mobile phone.
