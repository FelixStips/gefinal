                You are now participating in an economic experiment.
                This is a research project, which is designed to study economic decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment consists of two parts.
                After you finish both parts, there will be a short questionnaire followed by the payment.
                In total, the experiment should last around 90 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the game, you will interact <b>anonymously</b> with other participants through the computer.
                This means you will not know the identity of those you interact with, and they will not know yours.
                The participants you interact with are not necessarily sitting close to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please <b>do not talk or communicate</b> with other participants during the experiment.
                This might disturb other people and invalidate the session.
                Also, please turn off or put away your mobile phone.
            </p>
