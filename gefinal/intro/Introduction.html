                You are now participating in an economic experiment. This is a research project, which is designed to study economic decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment consists of two parts. After you finished both parts there will be a short questionnaire followed by the payment. In total, the experiment should last for around 90 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the game, you will interact with other participants through the computer. <b>Neither during nor after the games will you know with whom you have interacted.</b>
                The participants you interact with are not necessarily sitting close to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please <b>do not talk or communicate with other participants</b> during the experiment. This might disturb other people and invalidate the session. Also, please turn off or put away your mobile phone.
