               In each round, employers choose to employ zero, one, or two workers.
               To employ a worker, an employer needs to pay a wage. In return, employed workers provide effort.
               Employers' profits depend on the number of workers they employ, the wages they pay, and the effort each worker provides.
               They will make profits if the wage they pay is lower than the effort worth they receive.
            </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
            On the other hand, your profits will depend on

            </p>
            <p>
               The first part lasts for {{ shock_after_rounds }} rounds. Each round has two phases:
            </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
                1. First, a <b>market phase</b> lasting for {{ market_time }} seconds.
                During this phase, employers can submit job offers, which workers can accept.
                When submitting a job offer, an employer specifies two things
                <ul class="list" style="margin-top: -10px">
                    <li>	The wage they will pay  </li>
                    <li>	The effort they want the worker to choose </li>

            </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
           Once employers submit offers, workers get to see them and decide which to accept.
                The first worker to accept an offer will get it.
                <b>Each worker can accept at most one job offer in each round.
                Each employer can employ at most two workers.</b>
                Unaccepted offers are deleted at the end of the market phase.
            </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
                2. After the market phase, workers who accepted a job offer enter the <b>production phase</b>.
                In this phase, workers decide their effort.
                <b>Workers are not forced to provide the effort desired by the employer.
                They are free to choose any effort.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="block-sentence">
                Once all workers have chosen their effort, everyone's profits are calculated and the next round starts.
                The sum of profits across all rounds will determine your earnings for the experiment.
